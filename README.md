# user-api-auth
#laravel #passport #php

these are the two tasks. the registeration and login process are already authenticized by jwt 
and the user can't see any countries without taking a token(log in)

This is a Register, Login and logout API

I used passport as it's efficient 

I used also the built in responses in laravel and json built in class 

so it returns an error message (json) or return response 200(successful) token.
